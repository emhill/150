  <h1 id="project-4-objects-in-python">Project 4: Objects in Python</h1>

<p>In this project you will implement a text-based card game as well as the <code>Date</code> class we began during lecture. You may work in a team of 2-3 people, or alone.</p>

<h2 id="part-a-card-game">Part A: Card Game</h2>

<p>Using the <code>Card</code> class we went over in lecture (see <code>card.py</code>), create a file <code>game.py</code> that implements a basic card game. It can either require 2 players or 1 player and the computer. <strong>Every game <em>must</em> be unique.</strong></p>

<p>Your <code>game.py</code> program must include a <code>main</code> function as we went over in class (see <code>card.py</code>). You are encouraged to think about creating additional classes besides <code>Card</code> that might help implement your game, such as <code>Deck</code> or <code>Hand</code>, but this is not a formal requirement.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hints:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your first step should be drawing a mock-game play scenario for one game. What text will you output to the user? What will you ask them to input? How will you keep them aware of the status of their hand &amp; the game?</p>

    <p><strong>Example mock gameplay for crazy 8s:</strong></p>

    <pre><code>  Hand: 3H 4C 7D 8S 2H 5C 10H AH
         1  2  3  4  5  6   7  8
	
  Top of deck: 3D
  Do you want to (A) draw or (B) play card?
  &gt; B
  Which card? (1-8)
  &gt; 1
  Computer player drew a card
  Top of deck: 3H
  Do you want to (A) draw or (B) play card?
	
  ... etc ...
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Next think about what data you will need to keep track of throughout the game. How should you store that data? In a data structure like a list, single variables, or do you need to create additional classes?</li>
  <li>Create an implementation plan. Try to think of your problem in terms of features. List them out. Prioritize the features that are critical to gameplay. Are there some features that you could leave until later or possibly leave out completely and still have a working game? Do some features need to be implemented before others?</li>
  <li>Start implementing your features.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part-b-date">Part B: Date</h2>

<p>Begin by creating a file <code>date.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Date:
    """ a user-defined data structure that
        stores and manipulates dates
    """

    # the constructor is always named __init__ !
    def __init__(self, month, day, year):
        """ the constructor for objects of type Date """
        self.month = month
        self.day = day
        self.year = year


    # the "printing" function is always named __repr__ !
    def __repr__(self):
        """ This method returns a string representation for the
            object of type Date that calls it (named self).

             ** Note that this _can_ be called explicitly, but
                it more often is used implicitly via the print
                statement or simply by expressing self's value.
        """
        s =  "%02d/%02d/%04d" % (self.month, self.day, self.year)
        return s


    # here is an example of a "method" of the Date class:
    def isLeapYear(self):
        """ Returns True if the calling object is
            in a leap year; False otherwise. """
        if self.year % 400 == 0: return True
        elif self.year % 100 == 0: return False
        elif self.year % 4 == 0: return True
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>You should also create a file <code>main.py</code> that you will use to test that your <code>Date</code> class works correctly. Make sure this file includes a main function that is called like we did in <code>card2.py</code>.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-date">Understanding <code>Date</code></h3>

<p>Notice that in this <code>Date</code> class there are three <strong><em>data members</em></strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A data member holding the month (<code>self.month</code>)</li>
  <li>A data member holding the day of the month (<code>self.day</code>)</li>
  <li>A data member holding the year (<code>self.year</code>) </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <code>self</code> is used to denote <strong><em>any</em></strong> object (that is, any variable or value) of class <code>Date</code>.</p>

<h4 id="methods-are-just-functions">Methods are just functions…</h4>

<p>Object-oriented programming tends to have some of its own names for familiar things. For example, <em>method</em> is the “OOP” name for <em>function</em>. In particular, a <em>method</em> is a function whose first argument is <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>Date</code> class has an <code>__init__</code> method and a <code>__repr__</code> method. As we’ve discussed in class, Python expects to see these special methods in virtually every class. The double underscores before and after these method names indicate that these methods are special ones that Python knows to look for. In the case of <code>__init__</code>, this is the method that Python looks for when making a new <code>Date</code> object. In the case of <code>__repr__</code>, this is the method that Python looks for when it needs to <code>repr</code>esent the object as a string.</p>

<p>Notice the line</p>

<pre><code>s =  "%02d/%02d/%04d" % (self.month, self.day, self.year)
</code></pre>

<p>in the <code>repr</code> method. This constructs a string with the month, day, and the year, formatted very nicely to have exactly two digit places for the month, two digit places for the day, and four for the year.</p>

<p>We’ve also defined our own <code>isLeapYear</code> method. There are no double-underscores here, because Python didn’t “expect” this method, but it certainly doesn’t “object” to it either. (Clearly these puns have no <em>class</em>!)</p>

<h4 id="note-on-method">Note on “method”:</h4>

<p>Traditionally, functions called by objects are called <em>methods</em>. There is no really good reason for this. They are just like functions–the only thing special about them is that they are defined in a class and they are called after a dot or period following the name of an object. For example, try these in the python console:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from date import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(4, 7, 2015)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.isLeapYear()
False

&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = Date(3, 15, 2016)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2.isLeapYear()
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; Date(1, 1, 1900).isLeapYear()   # no variable needed!
False
</code></pre>

<h4 id="whats-up-with-self">What’s up with <code>self</code>?</h4>
<p>One odd thing about the above example is that <strong>three different objects</strong> of type <code>Date</code> are calling the <em>same</em> <code>isLeapYear</code> code. How does the <code>isLeapYear</code> method tell the different objects apart? </p>

<p>The method <strong>does not</strong> know the name of the variable that calls it! In fact, in the third example, there is <em>no</em> variable name! </p>

<p>The answer is <code>self</code>. The <code>self</code> variable holds <strong>the object that calls the method</strong>, including all of its data members.</p>

<p>This is why <code>self</code> is always the first argument to all of the methods in the <code>Date</code> class (and in any class that you define): because <code>self</code> is how the method can access the individual data members in the object that called it.</p>

<p><strong>Please notice also:</strong> this means that a method always has at least one argument, namely <code>self</code>. However, this value is passed  implicitly when the method is called. For example, <code>isLeapYear</code> is invoked in the example above as <code>Date(1,1,1900).isLeapYear()</code>, and Python automatically passed self, in this case the object <code>Date(1,1,1900)</code>, as the first argument to the <code>isLeapYear</code> method.</p>

<h4 id="testing-your-initial-date-class">Testing your initial <code>Date</code> class:</h4>

<p>Just to get a feel for how to test your new datatype, try out the following calls in the python console:</p>

<pre><code># create an object named d with the constructor
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(4, 7, 2015)  # use another day if you prefer...

# show d's value
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
04/07/2015

# a printing example
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'Tuesday is', d
Tuesday is 04/07/2015

# create another object named d2
# of *the same date*
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = Date(4, 7, 2015)

# show its value
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2
04/07/2015

# are they the same?
&gt;&gt;&gt; d == d2
False

# look at their memory locations
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(d)   # return memory address
413488      # your result will be different...

&gt;&gt;&gt; id(d2)  # again...
430408      # and this should differ from above!

# check if d2 is in a leap year...
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2.isLeapYear()
False

# yet another object of type Date
# a distant New Year's Day
# Q: where will you be on this date?
&gt;&gt;&gt; d3 = Date(1, 1, 2020)

# check if d3 is in a leap year
&gt;&gt;&gt; d3.isLeapYear()
True
</code></pre>

<h4 id="copy-and-equals">copy and equals</h4>

<p>Add the following code to your <code>Date</code> class and then test that it works:</p>

<pre><code>def copy(self):
    """ Returns a new object with the same month, day, year
        as the calling object (self).
    """
    dnew = Date(self.month, self.day, self.year)
    return dnew
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>copy</code> method returns a newly constructed object of type Date with the same month, day, and year that the calling object has. Remember that the calling object is named self, so the calling object’s month is <code>self.month</code>, the calling object’s day is <code>self.day</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Since you want to create a newly constructed object, you <em>need to call the constructor</em>. This is what you see happening in the copy method.</p>

<p>Try out these examples, which use next year’s New Year’s Day. First we don’t use <code>copy</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(1, 1, 2016)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = d
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(d)
430542      # your memory address may differ
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(d2)
430542      # but d2 should be the SAME as d!
&gt;&gt;&gt; d == d2
True           # so this should be True...
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you’ll show that <code>copy</code> does make a deep copy (instead of a copy of only the reference, or “shallow” copy):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import date; from imp import reload; reload(date); from date import *  # reload your file...
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(1, 1, 2016)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = d.copy()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
01/01/2016
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2
01/01/2016

&gt;&gt;&gt; id(d)
430568      # your memory address will differ
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(d2)
413488      # but d2 should be different from d!
&gt;&gt;&gt; d == d2
False         # thus, this should be false...
</code></pre>

<p>Next, add an <code>equals</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>def equals(self, d2):
    """ Decides if self and d2 represent the same calendar date,
        whether or not they are the in the same place in memory.
    """
    if self.year == d2.year and self.month == d2.month and self.day == d2.day:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>This method should return <code>True</code> if the calling object (named <code>self</code>) and the argument (named <code>d2</code>) represent the same calendar date. If they do not represent the same calendar date, this method should return <code>False</code>. The examples above show that the same calendar date may be represented at multiple locations in memory—in that case the <code>==</code> operator returns <code>False</code>. This method can be used to see if two objects represent the same calendar date, regardless of whether they are at the same location in memory.</p>

<p>As a reminder, here is the line to reload a file without exiting Python:</p>

<pre><code>import date; reload(date); from date import *
</code></pre>

<p>Try these examples (after reloading date.py with the above line) to get the hang of how this equals method works.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(1, 1, 2016)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = d.copy()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
01/01/2016
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2
01/01/2016
&gt;&gt;&gt; d == d2
False       # this should be False!

&gt;&gt;&gt; d.equals(d2)
True        # but this should be True!

&gt;&gt;&gt; d.equals(Date(1, 1, 2016))  # this is OK, too!
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; d == Date(1, 1, 2016)       # this tests memory addresses
False                           # so it should be False
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the next part of the lab asks you to implement a few methods for the Date class from scratch.</p>

<h3 id="modifications">Modifications</h3>

<p>Add the following methods to your <code>Date</code> class. Be sure to add a docstring to each of the methods you write. (Recall that the term method refers to a function that is a member of a user-defined class.)</p>

<h4 id="isafterself-d2">isAfter(self, d2)</h4>

<p>This method should return whether (True/False) <code>Date d2</code> is after <code>Date self</code>. <em>Hint</em>: see the <code>isBefore</code> example from class.</p>

<h4 id="tomorrowself">tomorrow(self)</h4>

<p>This method should <strong>NOT RETURN ANYTHING</strong>. Rather, it should change the calling object so that it represents one calendar day after the date it originally represented. This means that <code>self.day</code> will definitely change. What’s more, <code>self.month</code> and <code>self.year</code> might change.</p>

<p>Make sure to test your method with some tricky examples. Here are a couple of randomly chosen ones to get you started:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import date; from imp import reload; reload(date); from date import *  # re-read file...

&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(12, 31, 2015)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
12/31/2015
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.tomorrow()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
01/01/2016

&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(2, 28, 2016)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.tomorrow()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
02/29/2016
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.tomorrow()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
03/01/2016
</code></pre>

<h4 id="addndaysself-n">addNDays(self, N)</h4>

<p>This method only needs to handle nonnegative integer arguments <code>N</code>. Like the <code>tomorrow</code> method, this method should not return anything. Rather, it should <strong><em>change</em></strong> the calling object so that it represents <code>N</code> calendar days <em>after</em> the date it originally represented. </p>

<p><em>Don’t copy any code from the tomorrow method! <strong>Instead</strong></em>, consider how you could <strong><em>call</em></strong> the <code>tomorrow</code> method inside a <code>for</code> loop in order to implement this.</p>

<p>In addition, this method should <em>print</em> all of the dates from the starting date to the finishing date, inclusive of both endpoints. Remember that the line <code>print(self)</code> can be used to print an object from within one of that object’s methods.</p>

<p>Make sure to test your method. Here are some to start with:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import date; from imp import reload; reload(date); from date import *  # re-read file...

&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(4, 7, 2015)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.addNDays(3)
04/07/2015  # printing the first one is optional...
04/08/2015
04/09/2015
04/10/2015
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
04/10/2015

&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Date(4, 7, 2015)  # re-create this one
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.addNDays(1132)
04/07/2015 
04/08/2015
... lots of dates skipped ...
05/12/2018
05/13/2018  
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
05/13/2018    # graduation! (if you're now a first-year...)
</code></pre>

<p>You can check your own date arithmetic with this website: <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html">http://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html</a>.</p>

<h4 id="main">main</h4>

<p>Make sure your main class tests all the functionality that you have implemented: <code>isAfter</code>, <code>tomorrow</code>, <code>addNDays</code>. How do you know if your methods are implemented correctly? Does running each method once verify their correctness, or do you need to run them multiple times? For example, there are many different scenarios that can occur for the end of a month or the end of a year (leap year or not). Make sure you test all the cases you can think of.</p>

<p><em>Assignment adapted from <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5/Lab10">Harvey Mudd’s CS 5 Virtual Art Lab</a>.</em></p>

<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>

<p>You will be graded on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Correctness</strong>: Your code should perform as specified. Correctness will count for the largest portion of your grade.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong>: How well did you verify that your program meets the specification? This will be the second largest portion of your grade.</li>
  <li><strong>Docstrings</strong>: For each class &amp; method that you design from scratch, write a good docstring (<code>"""</code>). </li>
  <li><strong>Internal comments</strong>: Within functions, the more complicated parts of your code should also be described using “internal” comments (i.e., docstrings).</li>
  <li><strong>Programming style</strong>: Your variable names should be meaningful and your code as simple and clear as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Formatting style</strong>: Each line should be less than 80 characters long including spaces. You should break up long lines using <code>\</code>. </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submitting">Submitting</h1>

<p>When complete, your project should include the following python files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>card.py</code></li>
  <li><code>game.py</code></li>
  <li><code>date.py</code></li>
  <li><code>main.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Zip your project using the same steps as for the earlier project, giving the zip file the same name as your <code>project4_uLogin</code> folder name, and submit to google classroom.</p>
